## Description

**GFind** is a stand-alone text search and replace tool made with the Godot game engine.

Originally started as a learning project and a low-effort attempt to replace KDE's [KFind](https://apps.kde.org/kfind/) app, this tool has become my daily driver for search and replace operations on platforms where existing alternatives such as Stefan KÃ¼ng's [grepWin](https://tools.stefankueng.com/grepWin.html) are not available.
